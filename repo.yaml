  intro:
    content: An ansible playbook with templated configuration to apply to all LinkORB code repositories.
  configuration:
    title: Configuration
    content: |
      The playbook is configured using a `repo.yml` file in the root of your repository.

      This configuration let's you define variables that are used throughout the playbook and it's templates. For example, the `repo.yml` defines the name, license and visibility of your repository, the Docker base image to use.

      Please refer to [repo.schema.yaml](repo.schema.yaml) for the schema of this file.
  notes: |
    ### Dependencies security

    Organization-wide Dependabot alerts and pull requests are enabled for security vulnerabilities. Initially this
    repository generated a separate `dependabot.yaml` configuration file which would have served the same purpose as the
    global organization-wide settings.
