repo-ansible
============

Ansible playbooks with templated configuration to apply to all LinkORB code repositories.

What benefits do you get from using repo-ansible for your repository?

 - **CodeSpace devcontainers**<br>
   LAMP-based devcontainer with Apache, MariaDB and a phpMyAdmin.
 - **automated security and dependency updates via Dependabot**<br>
   Organization-wide settings ensure security alerts and pull requests are enabled for all repositories,
   and repo-ansible, doubles down on this configuration, makes sure that security and minor version updates
   created by Dependabot will automatically get merged.
 - **Contributors support**<br>
   Community guidelines, contributing notes, git hooks, codeowners for automated PR assignment, QA tooling/configuration,
   and the standardized LinkORB pull request template.
 - **Standardized repository files, GitHub repository management, and much more to come!**




## Get Started

### Configure

The playbook depends on the `repo.yml` configuration file which must reside at the root of your repository.
This configuration let's you define variables that are used throughout generation of repository files, workflows,
and in general standardisation across the organization repositories.

For example, you use `repo.yml` to define your projects repository name, description, license, visibility, code owners,
etc.

For all the options and switches, please refer to the JSON Schema definition of the configuration file:
[repo.schema.yaml](repo.schema.yaml).

#### Define README docs section content

The content for each section of this README was either retrieved from `repo.yaml` or Markdown partials stored in the
`docs/partials` folder. Managing content in this way allows you to centrally define documentation in
`repo.schema.yaml` inherited by each affected codebase while also allowing you to define repo-specific content in
`repo.yaml` and within the `/docs/partials` folder as Markdown partials.

When a playbook generates the README, it checks for Markdown partials in the `/docs` folder. If present, they override
repo-specific content defined in `repo.yaml` or content inherited from `repo.schema.yaml` defaults.

For example, if you define `readme.usage.content` in `repo.yaml`, but a Markdown file named `readme.usage.md` exists
in the `/docs` foder, the dynamic README inserts the Markdown content.

To make this possible, tasks defined in `retrieve-docs-data.yaml` retrieve the docs files data such as the filename
and path for each Markdown file so `README.md.j2` can check for the presence of Markdown files for each README section
and insert Markdown content if there is a match.

### Install repo-ansible and its dependencies

Ansible is required.
[How do I install Ansible on my system?](./docs/AnsibleInstallation.md)
[Encountered issues with Ansible execution?](./docs/AnsibleInstallation.md#Debugging-Ansible-issues)

Grab the latest version of the repository and its dependencies.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/linkorb/repo-ansible.git /tmp/repo-ansible

$ pip3 install -r /tmp/repo-ansible/requirements.txt
```

### Run the playbook

> [!NOTE]
> During execution your repository's' **README.md will be overwritten** with the generation rules used in repo-ansible.
> If you're running the playbook for the first time on your repository, be sure to
> *Review README.md file auto-generation, switches and rules* â†‘


```shell
/your-repository $ ansible-playbook /tmp/repo-ansible/playbook-cwd.yaml

PLAY [localhost] **************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ********************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

...
```

The playbook will load and validate `repo.yaml` according to the schema; then proceed to apply templates and checks to
your repository.

### Short reference configuration

> Required properties are **bolded**. YAML hierarchies are represented by newlines in the property column.
> The table is not exhaustive, only the most common properties and groups are documented in here. Refer to the
> repo.schema.yaml file for a complete overview of properties.

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** `string` |-| The git repository name.|
| **description** `string` |-| Repository description that shows up in the sidebar on GitHub, and as the first line of the README after the repository name.|
| **type** `string` |-| Classification of repository type. Influences what additional files repo-ansible will generate when run.<br>The last 3 listed types have been deprecated and should not be used on new projects.&nbsp; Accepted values:`php-web`,`php-library`,`php-cli`,`nodejs-web`,`nodejs-library`,`nodejs-cli`,`other`,`application`,`library`,`symfony-bundle`,||
| **codeowners** `array` |-| Each array item contains a file/directory pattern and an array of individuals or teams responsible for reviewing and maintaining files/directories that match the specified pattern. For a list of allowed patterns, refer to [CODEOWNERS syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).|
| license `string` |proprietary| Repository license&nbsp; Accepted values:`mit`,`gpl-v3`,`proprietary`,||

| github<br>topics `array` |-| GitHub topics. An array of strings.|
| github<br>default_branch `string` |main| Default branch configuration in GitHub (default main). Override for older repositories that still use master branch. Consider updating your repository to include a main branch and remove this option.|

| devcontainer<br>postStartCommand `string` |-| Additional (shell) commands to run when the container is started. This event takes place after the create event, but opposed to the create event it's triggered every time the container is started (including when it's resumed from a suspended state). In a typical JavaScript application you might set it to run a `npm run dev` or equivalent step.|
| devcontainer<br>repository `string` |ghcr.io/linkorb/php-docker-base| Image to use for devcontainer (registry image URL)|
| devcontainer<br>tag `string` |php8-review| Image tag|
