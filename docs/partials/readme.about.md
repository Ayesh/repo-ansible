Ansible playbooks with templated configuration to apply to all LinkORB code repositories.

What benefits do you get from using repo-ansible for your repository?

 - **CodeSpace devcontainers**<br>
   LAMP-based devcontainer with Apache, MariaDB and a phpMyAdmin.
 - **automated security and dependency updates via Dependabot**<br>
   Organization-wide settings ensure security alerts and pull requests are enabled for all repositories,
   and repo-ansible, doubles down on this configuration, makes sure that security and minor version updates
   created by Dependabot will automatically get merged.
 - **Contributors support**<br>
   Community guidelines, contributing notes, git hooks, codeowners for automated PR assignment, QA tooling/configuration,
   and the standardized LinkORB pull request template.
 - **Standardized repository files, GitHub repository management, and much more to come!**
